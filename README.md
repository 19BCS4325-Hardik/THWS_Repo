Dear Admission Committee,

Greetings! Explore my experimental endeavours showcased in this repository, featuring a compilation of practical and research projects. Feel free to peruse through my work. 

I have submitted my Films and Series Recommendation System as part of the Application Form, along with details of additional practical and research endeavours. The transcript lists the projects and their respective credits, with the exception of the Research Paper, which was conducted post-college and is currently awaiting publication. I have submitted a request for its publication, and anticipate it will be published next month.

Best regards,
Hardik Chauhan
